## Constraint Satisfaction
### N-Queens problem

In this exercise I explored Constraint Satisfaction Problems by implementing the N-Queens problem using symbolic constraints in a Jupyter notebook. 
I solved it using the Backtracking Search algorithm from [AIMA](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu).

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with anaconda3 installed and on the application path:

    jupyter notebook AIND-Constraint_Satisfaction.ipynb
